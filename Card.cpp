 * overloaded << operator for Card Class
Create 2 constant string arrays named RANKS and SUITS (RANKS will contain elements like g0h, gAh
etc and SUITS will contain gSh, gCh etc) and use these string arrays to print appropriate rank
and suit when displaying the card. The enumerators created in the card class will work like the
index for the above arrays.

store "XX"

Return output object [See overloaded << class example]
HINT: This function should print JH for jack of hearts or 5S for 5 spades etc for each card.
